# Neural-Network
Inspired by 3Blue1Brown's machine learning series, I used http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html as a resource to help me create a neural network using Python from scratch. My first attempt, neuralnetwork_simple.py, assumes a fixed structure with one hidden layer of 4 neurons. This was a stepping stone for neuralnetwork.py, which created a neural network generalized for any number of layers and neurons. I used MNIST as my sample data to train and test this neural network (i.e. mnist.pkl.gz). run_nn.py is used to train neuralnetwork.py with MNIST.
